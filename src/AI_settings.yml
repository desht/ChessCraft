# funName is the displayed name in-Game
#   can also be used by a player to invite this AI to their game
#   if you want more of one type avaliable, funName can be comma-delimited to add more AI
# eg. funName: "Bob, George, Moe" gives 3 AI of that type
# !! Names CANNOT be repeated, or only the last of that name will be avaliable !!
# if funName is null, will be the definition node (eg. ai01)
