v0.3 (not released)
now does terrain saving when a board is created
control panel itens are grey when inactive
can setup iConomy stakes - amount each player bets on winning (winner recieves double)
WorldEdit can instead be put in ChessCraft plugin folder or lib folder
moves players out of the way of moving chess pieces
games now auto-delete if not started 
added an optional "panel" material definition in the board definition: control panel can be different than the frame


v0.2.2 (18 Jul 2011)
Fixed a problem with en passant moves for Black
Fixed a problem with queen's side castling (was checking for King move to B file instead of C file - /facepalm)
Included twist.yml piece style by @ppp
When creating boards, you can now also add a '-pstyle <style>' option to override the board's default piece style. Should reduce the need to create new board definitions just to try out a different piece style.


v0.2.1 (13 Jul 2011):
Now only tells you if you are actually in one or more games at login


v0.2 (13 Jul 2011)
Piece selection/moving has changed: now pieces are selected & moved by waving a wand item 
- (new config item wand_item, default is empty hand) with left-click. 
- Much more usable, since it can be done from a distance - less running about the board needed. 
- Right-click still works but is deprecated and will print a warning every time it's used. 
- - Right-click will be removed in the next release.
Control panel on the side of each board with chess clock
- to-play indicator
- halfmove clock display
- ply count display
- and a set of buttons to make a lot of the /chess commands easier to use (e.g. you can now create a game on the board with one click).
More visible notification if you've been placed in check.
When you join a game, you can now be automatically teleported to it (new config itemauto_teleport_on_join, default true).
If a player logs out, their opponent may claim victory by default after a configurable delay (new config item forfeit_timeout, default 60 seconds).
Board lighting is now checked once per second by default, not once per 10 seconds. The same task also updates chess clocks on each board.
Implemented the 50-move rule (game is drawn if no pawn moves & no captures in the last 50 moves - see the halfmove clock on the control panel).
Various minor tweaks & bug fixes.


v0.1.1 (8 Jul 2011)
Fixed a logic error which was mistakenly treating any move into row 1 as a pawn promotion move.
