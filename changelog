v0.4 (development)
board rotation now supported - board orientation is decided by player orientation when created

added game results logging
- stored in plugins/ChessCraft/results/results.db, a SQLite database
- raw game results table, plus derived tables: ladder & league


v0.3.3 (1 Aug 2011)
Fixed a nasty bug relating to persistence - saved games were not correctly reloaded (board and game state were inconsistent)


v0.3.2 (30 Jul 2011)
Fixed (hopefully) NPE reported by @Joy in the entity listener


v0.3.1 (29 July 2011):

right-click piece moving removed
can now separately define board style & piece style
players must be online to be invited
moves players out of the way of moving chess pieces
added no_pvp option to config
players on a chess board are protected from monster attacks
- player damage is disabled

- this feature depends on WorldEdit
- WorldEdit can instead be put in ChessCraft plugin folder or lib folder
board creation now triggers data autosave
control panel items are grey when inactive
can setup economy stakes - amount each player bets on winning (winner receives double)
- supports iConomy 4, 5, & 6, BOSEconomy 6 & 7, EssentialsEco, & MultiCurrency (using Register)
games now auto-delete if not started 
pieces with nonsolid blocks (like torches) won't leave trails of items when they move
added an optional "panel" material definition in the board definition: control panel can be different than the frame
[[now automatically downloads Chesspresso-lib.jar if not found]]
- class file now included inside plugin, so lib is no longer required separately
major-ish code restructure
players now allowed to resign even when not their turn
players can now delete a game if they created it (or if not started & the person who joined left)
added partial-name matching for games
added option to highlight last move
- board definition can manually set material with "highlight"
- can also define "highlight_white_square & "highlight_black_square"
- highlight style can be configured in the board style definition
- - outline edges, highlight corners, use a checkerboard pattern, or draw a line
boards are now redrawn on load (if style changed / worldedit mistakes)
board control panel toplay indicator color on reload fixed
style "large" (7x7 board squares & matching pieces) is now included
support for Bukkit superperms (Permissions still used first if found, for now...)
AI SUPPORT ADDED :D
- games, if started without another player, will have an AI player "join"
- chess engine taken from jChecs: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jchecs/files/Sources/v0.1.0/jChecs-0.1.0-src.tgz
- settings: ai.min_move_wait - minimum time (seconds) before AI makes a move (0 is faster, but can be disorientatingly quick)
            ai.max_ai_games - limit the maximum concurrent AI game sessions (AI can be CPU-intensive) (0 disables AI)
- AI styles and difficulty can have named personas (defined in the included AI_settings.yml file)
-- players can invite specific AIs with these names
- project is now licensed under the GPLv3 instead of Creative Commons license
games & boards are now saved in seperate files
- will automativally impor old persist.yml file


v0.2.2 (18 Jul 2011)
Fixed a problem with en passant moves for Black
Fixed a problem with queen's side castling (was checking for King move to B file instead of C file - /facepalm)
Included twist.yml piece style by @ppp
When creating boards, you can now also add a '-pstyle <style>' option to override the board's default piece style. Should reduce the need to create new board definitions just to try out a different piece style.


v0.2.1 (13 Jul 2011):
Now only tells you if you are actually in one or more games at login


v0.2 (13 Jul 2011)
Piece selection/moving has changed: now pieces are selected & moved by waving a wand item 
- (new config item wand_item, default is empty hand) with left-click. 
- Much more usable, since it can be done from a distance - less running about the board needed. 
- Right-click still works but is deprecated and will print a warning every time it's used. 
- - Right-click will be removed in the next release.
Control panel on the side of each board with chess clock
- to-play indicator
- halfmove clock display
- ply count display
- and a set of buttons to make a lot of the /chess commands easier to use (e.g. you can now create a game on the board with one click).
More visible notification if you've been placed in check.
When you join a game, you can now be automatically teleported to it (new config itemauto_teleport_on_join, default true).
If a player logs out, their opponent may claim victory by default after a configurable delay (new config item forfeit_timeout, default 60 seconds).
Board lighting is now checked once per second by default, not once per 10 seconds. The same task also updates chess clocks on each board.
Implemented the 50-move rule (game is drawn if no pawn moves & no captures in the last 50 moves - see the halfmove clock on the control panel).
Various minor tweaks & bug fixes.


v0.1.1 (8 Jul 2011)
Fixed a logic error which was mistakenly treating any move into row 1 as a pawn promotion move.


v0.1 (4 Jul 2011)
Initial release
